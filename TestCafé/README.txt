For testcafe is more easier to run the scripts because you'll only need to download/install:
- Nodejs v14.17.5
- TestCafé 1.15.1 or higher (npm install -g testcafe or npm install testcafe inside the TestCafé folder)
- dotenv 10.0.0 (npm install dotenv)

All of the scripts are inside the package.json where on your CLI you only have to use the next command:
    npm run  "test-xxxx-xxxxx" (what is inside the double quotes are the scripts inside the mentioned package.json)

NOTE: Normally the .env file  it's not uploaded into your repository for security purposes. But in this case, i'll leave it to make it more easier to dowloand and run it.
