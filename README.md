Here i'll upload the scripts required for the bootcamp challenge.


Hello! Welcome to my GIT <3. Just one quick advices to make sure that everything would stick easy and clean to execute:

- Each one of the environments have his own readme.txt file where i explain how to run his own scripts.
- You'll need to be on the "../gitHub/challengeWizeLine/<RobotFramework/TestCafÃ©>" folder path in order to run the scripts. (Because every environment has his own way to run)
- Any question you could email me at : ricardorodriguez9802@gmail.com
